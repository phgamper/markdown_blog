# MarkdownBlog

MarkdownBlog is a lightweight blog software written in php and twitter bootstrap. Its purpose is to provide a easy way to share your thoughts without any database or special setup needed.
The content of the website can be provided in easy to use [markdown](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) files `(*.md)` instead. 

## Features
- Dynamic setup of your blog or website with simple configuration files but without any need of programming.
- Support for markdown and HTML files
- Easy to build navigation, including the ability to link external sites
- Different views generated by your markdown or html files:
  - A single page to show special content like 'Contact' or 'About'.
  - A ordered list of markdowns (the sample usecase of a blog)
  - Grouping topics in a dynamicly generated dropdown menue.
- Full responsive design due to the use of Twitter Bootstrap.
- Syntax highlighting for both HTML and markdown

## Quick start

1. Download [markdown.tar](https://github.com/phgamper/markdown_blog/releases) and extract the archive into your server's web folder. 
2. Modify the `config/general.ini` to personalize your website/blog. A sample configuration is provided in the `config/general.ini.sample`.
3. Copy your `*.md` files on the server and provide their location in the `config/config.ini`. Again a example is given. 
4. Make sure the server has read and execution access to all linked markdown files.
5. Share your thoughts and enjoy!
