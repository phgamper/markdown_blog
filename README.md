# MarkdownBlog

MarkdownBlog is a lightweight blog software written in php and twitter bootstrap. Its purpose is to provide a easy way to share your thoughts without any Database or special setup needed.
The content of the website can be provided in easy to use [markdown](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) files `(*.md)` instead. 

## Features
- Dynamic setup of your blog or website with simple configuration files but without any need of programming.
- Different views generated by your markdown files:
  - A single page to show special content like 'Contact' or 'About'.
  - A ordered list of markdowns (the sample usecase of a blog)
  - Grouping topics in a dynamicly generated dropdown menue.
- Full responsive design due to the use of Twitter Bootstrap.

## Quick start

1. Download [markdown.tar](https://github.com/phgamper/markdown_blog/releases) and extract the archive into your servers root directory.

2. Copy your `*.md~` files on the server and link them in the configuration file `config/config.ini` by editing the example in there. Additional information could be found in the [documentation]().

3. Make sure the server has read and execution access to all linked markdown files.

4. Modify the `config/general.ini` to personalize your blog.

5. Share your thoughts and enjoy!
