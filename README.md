## MarkdownBlog

MarkdownBlog is a lightweight blog softeware written in php and twitter bootstrap. Unlike as in common blog application like wordpress, MarkdownBlog works without any Database. This is because MarkdownBlog uses markdown files (*.md) instead. The application provides two different types of page views: One that shows a list of markdowns and one that shows a single file. Further a dropdown navigation is included, which is build dynamicaly according to file structure.
